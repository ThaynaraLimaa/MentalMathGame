# Mental Math Game - practice your mental math!

## About the project:

The Mental Math Game is a mini-game about math operations. The aim of the game is to help you practice and improve your mental math.
In Mental Math Game you can choose which math operation to practice (addition, subtraction, and multiplication, I haven’t integrated the division yet), how many questions it will have and the numbers range, it can be chosen to practice only with a short number (1 to 10) or higher (1 to 1000), it’s your choice.

## To be improved:

The project is ready to be used, but there are somethings that need to be improved:
- When the screen is smaller the game does not fits very well, specially the toggle menu.
- When using mobile it’s not possible to use the "-" when the operation result is negative.

## Technologies used:

- **HTML** 
- **CSS**
